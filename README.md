# Milestone 1 Pool'KV 99

The website is about my poolteam where I play semi professional pool in. You'll get a short introduction about how we came togeteher as well as who is in our team and which strengths each member has. 

Seperate the team itself will use it to see what our schedule is and when and where we have to play our matches. Additionally there is a leaguet table to see how our team is doing this season.
 
 
## UX

This site is for general users who want to know more about the team and teammembers who want to know more about fixtures and results. The site has divided these sections in different pages, with the information for the general users on the homepage. This beacause the teammembers are on the site for specific information and the general users need more generic information.

- As a site owner I want to have the social links open in a new tab/page of the browser so the user is not lost on our website
